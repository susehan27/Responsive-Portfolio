            <p>Hi! I'm Susanna! I'm currently a senior at Drexel taking a small break from classes to figure out the next steps in my life! This coding opportunity honestly came out of nowhere, totally unexpected that I'd be able to enroll in a program so close by! I'm so thankful that I have this opportunity to learn and I want to make sure that I make the most out of it! It's been great learning so many new and challenging things so far. I have always been interested in web designing through small things like designing my own blog page through wix's platform. I hope that I'll be able to develop and design better websites past the options that I can get on wix or other blogging platforms with the things I'll get to learn through this program! I also hope to meet and get to know many of the other classmates and expand my networking circle as well.</p>
            <p>Some other random things about me include that I am the oldest of two brothers in my family. I am Korean-American, born in Flushing, New York. I have lived in many different places including 4 different states and South Korea. Music has always been a part of my life including singing and playing piano/guitar. I'm a devoted Christian and highly involved with my church community on campus. I can be quite shy when meeting new people in a new environment but once I'm comfortable, you'll find that I'm an easy person to talk to! Other interests of mine include photography and "vlogging". I say "vlogging" because it's nothing professional or official, just whenever I get to travel somewhere and I remember to record stuff!</p>
